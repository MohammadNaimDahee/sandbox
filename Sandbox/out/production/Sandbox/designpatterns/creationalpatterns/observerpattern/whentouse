The OBSERVER PATTERN is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies
them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one the their methods.

When you need many other objects to receive an update when another object changes.
    Stock market with thousands of stocks needs to send updates to objects representing individual stocks
    The subject (publisher) sends many stocks to the observers
    The observers(Subscribers) takes the ones they want to use them

Loose coupling is a benefit
    The subject (publisher) doesn't need to know anything about the observers (Subscribers)

Negatives: The Subject (Publisher) may send updates that don't matter to the observer (subscriber)
