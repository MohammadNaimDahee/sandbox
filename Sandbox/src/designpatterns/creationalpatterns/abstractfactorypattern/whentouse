What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?
The FACTORY Pattern alo

It is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated
    The method that orders the object
    The factories that build the object
    The final object
    The final objects contain objects that use the Strategy Pattern
        Composition: Object class fields are objects

What can you do with an Abstract Factory?

    Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class
    Use when you have many objects that be added, or changed dynamically during runtime
    You can model anything you can imagine and have those objects interact through common interfaces
    The BAD: things can get complicated
